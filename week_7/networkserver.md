Internet is a group of web server, you access your web browser from your device that's wired by wifi, wifi is the router(they know where the websites are at) that allows internet access, your device send requests to router, router go find where the web server are at (and router is a server that routs thing, too), a server has a bunch of websites (and its pages, things after /) interaction is made by router taking back and forth

client server architecture: send request accessing and respond, 404: I can't find the website

HTTP: protocol allows resources to be requested and sent on the internet (where client request, network transfer, server sends response all the way back to client via network)

404 not found: client error

in inspect: request header and response header, 200 ok: can connect to server, everything on the website are requested at the same time, memory cash: by refreshing

refresh: depends on how much time it takes to load, can see it in inspect too, to speed up loading speed, click disable cache (for the entire window!!!), shift command R= hard refresh, hard refresh may white your screen (stuck) it takes longer time to load because it re complie and load everything (you can find it in inspect network)

open a terminal: pin is the simplest request (control C to get rid of time out)

Every client and website has its own IP
