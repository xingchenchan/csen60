    -cross site scripting: inserts html on your webpage and steal stuff, they replace script tags with a new one, pass information fromt the page to foriegn page, download user's cookies and passwords

        -How?:  attacker provides a link and let you go to their java script and let the user navigate to there

        -mitigation: don't allow any html to be inserted, against SQL injection
